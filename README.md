# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to make code simple and reusable, with a lot of comments to leave out ambiguity. Having code that can scale and be used in multiple places is key to adaptable code. This CRUD Python module can be used in a multitude of different ways from making another dash project to writing database queries in MongoDB.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I try to approach a problem with logic. I made sure to understand what was wanted and plot out a plan as to how to get there. This differs a lot from how I used to try to code when I was first starting off. Some techniques I would use in the future is writing code in blocks so that I do not overwhelm myself with trying to figure out an entire project from scratch.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists design, develop, and analyze software and hardware used to solve problems. This matters because progression of things is necessary. The work done here I think would streamline the process of training and getting more dogs that could work in the field of rescue which in turn saves lives. This could probably take months to do if it was done manually. This makes things a lot easier on the company and the people that need the help.
